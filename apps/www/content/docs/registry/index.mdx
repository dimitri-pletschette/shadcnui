You can use the `shadcn` CLI to run your own component registry. Running your own
component registry allows you to distribute your custom components, hooks, pages, and
other files to any React project.

Registry items are automatically compatible with the `shadcn` CLI and `Open in v0`.

## Requirements

You are free to design and host your custom registry as you see fit. The only requirement is that your registry items must be valid JSON files that conform to the [registry-item schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-item-json).

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Add a registry.json file

Create a `registry.json` file in the root of your project. This `registry.json` file must conform to the [registry schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-json).

```json title="registry.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json",
  "name": "acme",
  "homepage": "https://acme.com",
  "items": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

</Steps>

## Add a registry item

<Steps>

### Create your component

Add your first component. Here's an example of a simple `<HelloWorld />` component:

```tsx title="registry/hello-world/hello-world.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function HelloWorld() {
  return <Button>Hello World</Button>
}
```

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** This example places the component in the `registry` directory. You
  can place it anywhere in your project.
</Callout>

```txt
registry
└── hello-world
    └── hello-world.tsx
```

### Add your component to the registry

To add your component to the registry, you need to add your component definition to `registry.json`.

```json title="registry.json" showLineNumbers {6-17}
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json",
  "name": "acme",
  "homepage": "https://acme.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "hello-world",
      "type": "registry:block",
      "title": "Hello World",
      "description": "A simple hello world component.",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "registry/hello-world/hello-world.tsx",
          "type": "registry:component"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</Steps>

## Build your registry

<Steps>

### Install the shadcn CLI

Note: the `build` command is available in the `shadcn@canary` version of the CLI.

```bash
npm install shadcn@canary
```

### Add a build script

Add a `registry:build` script to your `package.json` file.

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "registry:build": "shadcn build"
  }
}
```

### Run the build script

Run the build script to generate the registry JSON files.

```bash
npm run registry:build
```

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note:** By default, the build script will generate the registry JSON files
  in `public/r` e.g `public/r/hello-world.json`.

You can change the output directory by passing the `--output` option. See the [shadcn build command](/docs/cli#build) for more information.

</Callout>

</Steps>

## Serve your registry

If you're running your registry on Next.js, you can now serve your registry by running the next.js server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your files will now be served at `http://localhost:3000/r/[NAME].json` eg. `http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json`.

## Publish your registry

To make your registry available to other developers, you can publish it by deploying your project to a public URL.

## CLI

To install a registry item using the `shadcn` CLI, use the `add` command followed by the URL of the registry item.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:3000/r/hello-world.json
```

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when building components for a registry.

- The following properties are required for the block definition: `name`, `description`, `type` and `files`.
- Make sure to list all registry dependencies in `registryDependencies`. A registry dependency is the name of the component in the registry eg. `input`, `button`, `card`, etc.
- Make sure to list all dependencies in `dependencies`. A dependency is the name of the package in the registry eg. `zod`, `sonner`, etc.
- **Imports should always use the `@/registry` path.** eg. `import { HelloWorld } from "@/registry/hello-world/hello-world"`
